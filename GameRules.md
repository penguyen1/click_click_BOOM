# click_click_BOOM


##### `click_click_BOOM` works just like the classic game, Minesweeper. Depending on the level of difficulty of your choosing, you are given a finite amount of boxes where you must strategically determine and avoid randomly placed mines throughout the gameboard using given number indicators. 

##### The number indicators will tell you how many mines are adjacent to the box. (example: `1` indicates that there is only 1 mine adjacent to it, whereas `3` indicates that there are 3 mines adjacent to the box) Simple, right?

##### To win, dodge all the mines until all the boxes are gone! Otherwise, `Game Over, You lose!`
